### Source Code

The source code of this blog website was forked from [brennanbrown/watery](https://github.com/brennanbrown/watery). **Watery** is a minimalist, bare-bones theme for the popular JAMstack file-based CMS Jekyll that only uses the `<80kb` [**Water.css** framework](https://github.com/kognise/water.css) (hence the name!), while still following the best practices possible for accessibility and search-engine optimization.

This project is aimed towards those curious about using Jekyll for the first time, and want to build from as close to scratch as possible. Alternatively, it still has all the features required for creating a hassle-free, informational website or blog in just a few clicks.

As of November 1st, 2020, with over 100 posts on Watery, the website scores a perfect 100 in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO on an audit with [**Google Lighthouse**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).

<!-- ### Features

Despite Watery's minimalist nature, there are a few interesting features that have been added:

- A fully customizable and empty `_BLANK_config.yml` to make getting up-and-running easy.
- Having a `_pages` collection for easier organization.
- Auto-generated links to newly created pages in the navigation.
- An author bio at the end of each post. (Located in `_inclues/author.html`)
- Full Rouge support for syntax highlighting. (Currently using `base16.solarized.light`)
- Auto-generated RSS feed, sitemap, accessibility features, and search-engine optimization.

### Blog

There are a lot of jekyll blog themes available, but this theme stands out for two reasons:

1. Simplicity. No fancy pictures or scrolling nav-bar or any other bling bling stuff to distract readers from the content. I go for this theme just because its contant first idea.
2. Tag. Tag works as category for the blogs. When blogs pile up day after day, it becomes extremely difficult to find one specific article both for readers and myself. With tags, all articles are neatly sorted and nicely listed.

### Content

This blog mainly collects my study notes on math and programming. I might also upload some reading notes as well as travel logs.
