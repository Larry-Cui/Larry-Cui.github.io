This post is based on a [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/KxvKCSwlUv8) by teclado, which I belive, is the clearest explanation of virtual environment for python available online.

## Why do we need virtual environment for Python projects?

Python is a fast evloving language, you can tell its development pace by looking at the versions released almost every month. The proper functioning of Python projects also rely on a lot of 3rd party libraries, or as people call them, depencies, which are updating quickly along the way as well. 

Each version upgrade might be small, but accumulative upgrades eventually lead to fundamental changes to some functions or variables, and the project developed on certain version of Python and libraries may not run correctly in the latest version. Since there are so many versions of Python itself and the 3rd party libraries, your projects will inevitably run into conflicts. 

A virtual environment is the way to solve this version conflict problem. Simply put, we put the corresponding version of python and all libraries/depencies into the same file folder with the project, creating a mini environment for the project. Whenver the project run, it runs under this very environment, no matter what other versions the computer are installed, or other projects depend on.

## Pythons on your Mac

You may have installed different versions of Python on your Mac. To check the versions, you type `python` in the Terminal, then press `tab` button.

You can see that I have both python 2 and 3 installed on my Mac, and the exact versions are 2.7 and 3.11, respectively.

## Default python directory

Now here comes the question, if you key in some python command in the Terminal, which version would the computer use to execute your command?

To find out the answer, we can type `echo $PATH$` and press `return`:

`echo $PATH$` gives you a list of directories, each separated by a colon. In layman's terms, a path (or the search path) is the list of directories that will be searched for anything that you type on the command line.

You can see that the directory of python 3.11 comes before that of 2.7, so theoretically, whatever python command I key in, the system should search any corresponding word in 3.11 versions.

However, here I have a small problem, for whenever I type `python -V`, it pops up the older version as below. But anyway, this example shows that we need to keep an eye on the correct version the system will look for when executing our python command.




`python3 -m venv my_env`

`source my_env/bin/activate`

`deactivate`
