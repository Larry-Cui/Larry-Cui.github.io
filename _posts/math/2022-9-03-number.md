## Trivia Definitions

- Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with $a \neq 0$. We say $a$ divides $b$, denoted by $a \mid b$, if there exists an integer $c$ such that $b=ac$. And we say that $a$ is a <span style="color: Magenta">divisor</span> (or factor) of $b$, and $b$ is a <span style="color: Magenta">multiple</span> of $a$. If $a$ does not divide $b$, we write $a \nmid b$. If $a \mid b$ and $0<a<b$, then $a$ is called a <span style="color: Magenta">proper divisor</span> of $b$.
- A divisor of $n$ is called a <span style="color: Magenta">trivial divisor</span> of $n$ if it is either 1 or $n$ itself. A divisor of $n$ is called a <span style="color: Magenta">non-trivial divisor</span> if it is a divisor of $n$, but is neither 1, nor $n$.

## Euclid Theorem

> There are infinitely many primies

**Proof:** Suppose that $P_1 ,P_2, \dots ,P_k$ are all the primes. Consider the number $N = P_1 P_2 \cdots P_k + 1$. Since $N$ cannot be divided by any know primes, $N$ itself must be a new prime. But this conclusion contradicts the assertion of the case.
