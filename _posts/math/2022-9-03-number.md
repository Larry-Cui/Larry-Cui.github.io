## Trivia Definitions

- Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with $a \neq 0$. We say $a$ divides $b$, denoted by $a \mid b$, if there exists an integer $c$ such that $b=ac$. And we say that $a$ is a <span style="color: Magenta">divisor</span> (or factor) of $b$, and $b$ is a <span style="color: Magenta">multiple</span> of $a$. If $a$ does not divide $b$, we write $a ∤ b$. If $a \mid b$ and $0<a<b$, then $a$ is called a <span style="color: Magenta">proper divisor</span> of $b$.
- A divisor of $n$ is called a <span style="color: Magenta">trivial divisor</span> of $n$ if it is either 1 or $n$ itself. A divisor of $n$ is called a <span style="color: Magenta">non-trivial divisor</span> if it is a divisor of $n$, but is neither 1, nor $n$.
- If $x \equiv a \;(\mathrm{mod}\; n)$ and $ 0 \leq a \leq n - 1$,  then $a$ is called the <span style="color: Magenta">least (non-negative) residue</span> of $x$ modulo $n$. For any negative numbers, the residue is the positive distance of the largest negative multiple less than negative number. For example, $-12 \; \mathrm{mod} \; 7 = 2$.

## Euclid Theorem

> There are infinitely many primes

**Proof:** Suppose that $P_1 ,P_2, \dots ,P_k$ are all the primes. Consider the number $N = P_1 P_2 \cdots P_k + 1$. Since $N$ cannot be divided by any know primes, $N$ itself must be a new prime. But this conclusion contradicts the assertion of the case.

## Prime Equal or Less than Factorial + 1

> If $n$ is an integer $\geq 1$, then there is a prime $p$ such that $n<p \leq n!+1$.

**Proof:** Consider the integer $N = n! +1$. If $N$ is a prime, we may take $p = N$ and the theorem holds. If $N$ is not a prime, it must has a prime factor $p$ that $p \mid N$. Suppose $p \leq n$, then $p \mid n!$, hence $p \mid (N - n!)$, which is impossible since $N - n! = 1$. Therefore, $p > n$.

## Bertrand–Chebyshev Theorem

> For every $n>1$, there is always at least one prime $p$ such that $$ n<p<2n $$

**Proof:** Omitted.

<br>

## No Prime in Between

> If $n$ is an integer $\geq 2$, then there are no primes between $n! +2$ and $n! +n$.

**Proof:** Since $n!$ is a product of all integers between 1 and $n$, then $2 \mid (n! +2)$, $3 \mid (n! + 3)$, $\cdots, (n-1) \mid (n!+n), n \mid (n! + n)$.

## Largest Prime Limit

> If $n$ is an composite number, then $n$ has a prime divisor $p$ such that $p \leq \sqrt{n}$.

**Proof:** Let $p$ be the smallest prime divisor of $n$. If $n=rs$, then $p \leq r$ and $p \leq s$. Hence, $p^2 \leq rs = n$. That is, $p \leq \sqrt{n}$.

This theorem can be used to find all the prime factors of number $n$ with a linear search up to $\sqrt{n}$. This procedure is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes, attributed to the ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician Eratosthenes of Cyrene.

## Module Theorems

> For all $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $ n \in Z^+$, if $a \equiv b \;( \mathrm{mod} \; n)$ and $c \equiv d \;(\mathrm{mod} \; n)$, then:
>
> - $a \pm b \equiv c \pm d  \;(\mathrm{mod} \; n)$
> - $a \cdot b \equiv c \cdot d  \;(\mathrm{mod}\; n)$
> - $a^m \equiv b^m  \;(\mathrm{mod}\; n)$

**Proof:** We prove the last one and an illustration of the way to prove the first and second.

We already know that $a \equiv b \;(\mathrm{mod}\; n)$. Let $a = kn + r$ and $b=ln+r$. We have,

$$
a^m = [(kn)^m + \cdots + c\cdot(kn)r^{m-1} + r^m]
$$

and

$$
b^m = [(ln)^m + \cdots + c'\cdot(ln)r^{m-1} + r^m]
$$

We can see that any terms before $r^m$ is divisible by $n$, and $r^m \equiv r^m \;(\mathrm{mod}\; n)$.

## Residue Class

If $x =a \;(\mathrm{mod}\; n)$, then $a$ is called a residue of $x$ modulo $n$. The residue class of $a$ modulo $n$, denoted by $[a]_n$ (or just $[a]$ if no confusion will be caused), is the set of all those integers that are congruent to $a$ modulo $n$. That is,

$$
\begin{align*}
[a]_n
&= \{ x: x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } x \equiv a \;(\bmod\; n) \} \\
&= \{ a + kn: k \in \mathbb{Z} \}
\end{align*}
$$

In residue classes modulo 2, $[0]_2$ is the set of all even integers, and $[1]_2$ is the set of all odd integers.

## Euler's Totient Function

In number theory, Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer $n$ that are <span style="color: Magenta">relatively prime</span> to $n$.

It is written using the Greek letter phi as $ \varphi (n)$ or $ \phi (n)$, and may also be called Euler's phi function.

In other words, it is the number of integers $k$ in the range $1 \leq k \leq n$ for which the greatest common divisor gcd$(n, k)$ is equal to 1. The integers $k$ of this form are sometimes referred to as totatives of $n$.

For example, the totatives of $n = 9$ are the six numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8. They are all relatively prime to 9, but the other three numbers in this range, 3, 6, and 9 are not, since gcd$(9, 3) =$ gcd$(9, 6) = 3$ and gcd$(9, 9) = 9$. Therefore, $\phi(9) = 6$.

As another example, $\phi(1) = 1$ since for $n = 1$ the only integer in the range from 1 to $n$ is 1 itself, and gcd$(1, 1) = 1$.

> If two numbers $a$ and $b$ are **relatively prime**, then $\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)$.

**Proof:** Let $\phi(a) = m$, $\phi(b)=n$, then we have:

$$
1 \leq a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m \leq a \text{ , where gcd } (a_i, a)=1
$$

$$
1 \leq b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n \leq b \text{ , where gcd } (b_i, b)=1
$$

Since $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, we also know that gcd $(a_i, b)=1$ and gcd $(b_i, a)=1$. So all products of $a_i b_i$ are relatively prime to $ab$, i.e., gcd$(a_i b_i, ab)=1$. And we conclude that there are $mn$ terms of $a_i b_i$.

## Multiplicative Inverse

Two integers $a$ and $b$ are said to be <span style="color: Magenta">multiplicative inverse</span> if

$$
ab \equiv 1 \;(\mathrm{mod} \; n)
$$

when $n$ is a positive integer greater than 1.

Given any couple of $(a,n)$, $b$ does not always exist. This fact was stated by the following theorem.

> The multiplicative inverse $b = 1/a$ modulo $n$ exists if and only if
> $$ \mathrm{gcd}(a,n)=1 $$

**Proof:** We know from the given condition gcd$(a,n)=1$ that, least common multiple, lcm$(a,n)=an$. Any number less than $an$ is not dividable by both $a$ and $n$. As a result, any element in set A of $\{a, 2a, 3a, \dots, (n-1)a  \}$ cannot be divided by $n$, and we can get the full residue classes modulo $n$, i.e., $\{ 1, 2, 3, \dots, (n-1) \}$ from set A.

To prove this, first we notice that no element in set A is divisible by $n$, so we have exact $n-1$ residues from set A elements modulo $n$.

Second, we prove no two residues are the same by way of contradiction. Assume residue of two elements are same at $r$, we can write these two elements as $kn+r$ and $gn+r$.

If we subtract these two numbers, we get $(k-g)n$, which is dividable by $n$. On the other hand, we also know that the subtraction $(k-g)n$ must also be dividable by $a$, as any elements in set A is dividable by $a$, so is their subtractions. This make $(k-g)n$, a number less than $an$ also a common multiple of $a,n$. However, it's impossible as $an$ is the lcm.

We have $n-1$ residues from set A, and each residue is different, so all residues must be the set of $\{ 1, 2, 3, \dots, (n-1) \}$. There must be a number $b$ from the set A that $ab \equiv 1 \;(\mathrm{mod} \; n)$.

> **Corollary:** for all integers $x$ and $y$, not both zero, if $d=\text{gcd}(x,y)$, then there exist integers $s, t$ such that $xs+yt=d$.
