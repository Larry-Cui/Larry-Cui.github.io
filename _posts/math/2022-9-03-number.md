## Trivia Definitions

- Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with $a \neq 0$. We say $a$ divides $b$, denoted by $a \mid b$, if there exists an integer $c$ such that $b=ac$. And we say that $a$ is a <span style="color: Magenta">divisor</span> (or factor) of $b$, and $b$ is a <span style="color: Magenta">multiple</span> of $a$. If $a$ does not divide $b$, we write $a ∤ b$. If $a \mid b$ and $0<a<b$, then $a$ is called a <span style="color: Magenta">proper divisor</span> of $b$.
- A divisor of $n$ is called a <span style="color: Magenta">trivial divisor</span> of $n$ if it is either 1 or $n$ itself. A divisor of $n$ is called a <span style="color: Magenta">non-trivial divisor</span> if it is a divisor of $n$, but is neither 1, nor $n$.
- If $x \equiv a \;(\mathrm{mod}\; n)$ and $ 0 \leq a \leq n - 1$,  then $a$ is called the <span style="color: Magenta">least (non-negative) residue</span> of $x$ modulo $n$. For any negative numbers, the residue is the positive distance of the largest negative multiple less than negative number. For example, $-12 \; \mathrm{mod} \; 7 = 2$.

## Euclid Theorem

> There are infinitely many primes

**Proof:** Suppose that $P_1 ,P_2, \dots ,P_k$ are all the primes. Consider the number $N = P_1 P_2 \cdots P_k + 1$. Since $N$ cannot be divided by any know primes, $N$ itself must be a new prime. But this conclusion contradicts the assertion of the case.

## Prime Equal or Less than Factorial + 1

> If $n$ is an integer $\geq 1$, then there is a prime $p$ such that $n<p \leq n!+1$.

**Proof:** Consider the integer $N = n! +1$. If $N$ is a prime, we may take $p = N$ and the theorem holds. If $N$ is not a prime, it must has a prime factor $p$ that $p \mid N$. Suppose $p \leq n$, then $p \mid n!$, hence $p \mid (N - n!)$, which is impossible since $N - n! = 1$. Therefore, $p > n$.

## Bertrand–Chebyshev Theorem

> For every $n>1$, there is always at least one prime $p$ such that $$ n<p<2n $$

**Proof:** Omitted.

## No Prime in Between

> If $n$ is an integer $\geq 2$, then there are no primes between $n! +2$ and $n! +n$.

**Proof:** Since $n!$ is a product of all integers between 1 and $n$, then $2 \mid (n! +2)$, $3 \mid (n! + 3)$, $\cdots, (n-1) \mid (n!+n), n \mid (n! + n)$.

## Largest Prime Limit

> If $n$ is an composite number, then $n$ has a prime divisor $p$ such that $p \leq \sqrt{n}$.

**Proof:** Let $p$ be the smallest prime divisor of $n$. If $n=rs$, then $p \leq r$ and $p \leq s$. Hence, $p^2 \leq rs = n$. That is, $p \leq \sqrt{n}$.

This theorem can be used to find all the prime factors of number $n$ with a linear search up to $\sqrt{n}$. This procedure is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes, attributed to the ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician Eratosthenes of Cyrene.

## Module Theorems

> For all $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $ n \in Z^+$, if $a \equiv b \;( \mathrm{mod} \; n)$ and $c \equiv d \;(\mathrm{mod} \; n)$, then:
>
> - $a \pm b \equiv c \pm d  \;(\mathrm{mod} \; n)$
> - $a \cdot b \equiv c \cdot d  \;(\mathrm{mod}\; n)$
> - $a^m \equiv b^m  \;(\mathrm{mod}\; n)$

**Proof:** We prove the last one and an illustration of the way to prove the first and second.

We already know that $a \equiv b \;(\mathrm{mod}\; n)$. Let $a = kn + r$ and $b=ln+r$. We have,

$$
a^m = [(kn)^m + \cdots + c\cdot(kn)r^{m-1} + r^m]
$$

and

$$
b^m = [(ln)^m + \cdots + c'\cdot(ln)r^{m-1} + r^m]
$$

We can see that any terms before $r^m$ is divisible by $n$, and $r^m \equiv r^m \;(\mathrm{mod}\; n)$.
